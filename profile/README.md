# Welcome to the NIHR RDNCC and IS Function's GitHub 🌟

## Overview 🏠
This organisation, representing the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Research Delivery Network and IS Function, hosts a collection of repositories focused on digital tools and infrastructure for clinical research in the UK. The repositories cover APIs, web applications, infrastructure-as-code, and integrations.

## Technology 📚
.NET 8+ is the preferred framework of choice for building applications. .NET is an enterprise open-source framework with a broad development community and rich selection of third-party libraries. Some of our simpler applications also leverage Next.JS as the web application framework. Older solutions have been developed in Java. We typically use Terraform for IaC, with AWS being our preferred cloud platform of choice.

Let's keep striving for excellence and continue to make great things happen in UK clinical research, and beyond! 🚀
